            <p>
                Hello, my name is <abbr title="Yuen Ming">YM</abbr>, but I go by <strong>Venus</strong>. My birthday is 28<sup>th</sup>October. I am an international student from Hong Kong. I am currently in the program of <em>Interactive Media Design</em>, and it is the first semester of my study. Upon completion of the program, I hope that I will be able to land a job in the creative media field.

                I enjoy taking pictures of people around me, especially when they are not prepared, because I believe that spontaneous pictures look more natural and carry much more authenticity. I would rather seeing people being their real self rather than intentionally striking a pose and making a smile in front of a camera. This habit of mine always leads to my friends and my family members complaining that the pictures that I take for them never do them justice. Having said that, I think taking artistic and/ or commercial pictures with professional settings are pretty captivating as well, and are things I am likely to work on going further down the road.
